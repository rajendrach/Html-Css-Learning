                    <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
                        There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed,
                        and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters,
                        game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!</p>
                    <p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is what you get when you download Java software. The JRE
                        consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and supporting Java
                        platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you need to
                        run it in your Web browser.</p>
                    <p>Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
                        specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key
                        advantages of learning Java Programming:</p>

                    <p>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

                            The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).</p>
                    <p>Following is an example demonstrating Java inheritance. In this example, you can observe two classes namely Calculation and My_Calculation.

                            Using extends keyword, the My_Calculation inherits the methods addition() and Subtraction() of Calculation class.

                            Copy and paste the following program in a file with name My_Calculation.java</p>
                    <p>The Superclass reference variable can hold the subclass object, but using that variable you can access only the members of the superclass, so to access the members of both classes it is recommended to always create reference variable to the subclass.

                            If you consider the above program, you can instantiate the class as given below. But using the superclass reference variable ( cal in this case) you cannot call the method multiplication(), which belongs to the subclass My_Calculation.</p>
